# Bruteforce-Knapsack-Problem
My implementation and solution to knapsack problem in Java using bruteforce method.

# Task:
Implement solution of knapsack problem using brute force method. Generate characteristic
vectors and find the maximum total value of items that total weight do not exceed the
maximum capacity of a knapsack.
Each student in a group has different file with data. File number is the position of a student
in a group on a list in a file with points. First line in a file is the maximum capacity of a
knapsack, next lines contains the value and weight of an object that may be packed in a
knapsack.
Print the solution: characteristic vector, total value and total weight of items in a knapsack.
Optional: print execution time of your algorithm.
